# creating new github branch and working with it from your terminal:

- create new branch:

```
~ git branch [name of the branch]
```

- push new branch to remote git repository:

```
~ git push -u origin [name of branch]
```

- check which branches you have locally:

```
~ git branch
```

- switch to new created branch:

```
~ git switch [name of the branch]
```
